    <p class = "Cafedesc">Caf&eacute;s are types of restaurants which predominantly serve coffee and baked goods. Theyre popular
        social settings and are often times a place for casual work or relaxation as opposed to a usual restaurant
        setting which is more strictly for eating. Here you will see some popular kinds of food and drink which you
        can expect to find in a Caf&eacute;. More information can be found at: <a class = "CafeDesc" href="https://esquirescoffee.co.uk/news/why-coffee-shops-so-popular/">This site.</a>

    <div class = "foodgrid"> <!--this div defines a section of the page that I use a grid to make. i wanted a style where an image
        and a description of the image can be found side by side, and I wanted to alternate the positions of images and text so I
        used a grid to do so. This is simply done by sectioning out images and description paragraphs and the rest is done using css styling-->

        <div class = "section"><p>A croissant is a flaky pastry made from folding layers of dough and butter together,
            eventually made and baked into a crescent shape. Its a popular pastry which originates from France.
        </p></div>

        <div class = "section"><p>Coffee is a drink made by brewing ground coffee beans in water. This creates
            a dark and bitter drink which is either drank black as is, or combined with some kind of
            flavoring, sugar, and/or cream in order to enhance the flavor or take some of the bitterness away.
            Its a popular drink because of its caffeinating properties, making it a common drink in the
            morning, and is always served in a Caf&eacute;.

        <div class = "section"><img class = "img_cls" src="images/donuts.png" alt="Donuts"></div>
        <div class = "section"><p>Donuts are a kind of pastry made from frying dough. While they can be eaten plain, donuts
            are often accompanied with a variety of toppings including but not limited to, sugar, frosting, fruit, etc.
            Donuts have early origins in Latin America, but were popularized greatly in England and North America.
            Theyre extremely popular and are paired often with coffee, making them a common Caf&eacute; pastry.
        </p></div>

            <div class = "section"><p>Juice is a drink made from pressing fruits and/or vegetables in order to extract their natural
                liquids. Theyre a refreshing way to consume fruits and are a popular morning time drink, which means they
                commonly are sold in Caf&eacute;s as an alternative to the more popular coffee.
